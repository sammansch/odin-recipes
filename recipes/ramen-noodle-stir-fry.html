        <p>This doesn’t require too many ingredients, and by using ground beef and instant ramen noodles, this dish can’t come together any quicker.

            The noodles just need 3-4 minutes to get nice and tender while your ground beef gets that beautiful crumble before you stir in the sauciest of all sauces that require only a few pantry staples.
            
            From there, you can stir in those softened ramen noodles to sop up all those saucy bits.

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (3.5-ounce) packages instant ramen noodles, flavor packets discarded
            <li>1/3 cup beef stock
            <li>1/4 cup oyster sauce
            <li>1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
            <li>1 teaspoon Sriracha, or more, to taste
            <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef
            <li>1 cup diced sweet onion
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
            <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced
            <li>1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot of boiling water, cook ramen noodles until tender, about 3-4 minutes; rinse with cold water and drain well.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together beef stock, oyster sauce, rice wine vinegar and Sriracha.</li>
            <li>Heat sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef and onion, and cook until beef has browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks; drain excess fat.</li>
            <li>Stir in garlic and ginger until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in beef stock mixture, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.</li>
            <li>Stir in ramen noodles until heated through and evenly coated in sauce, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, garnished with green onions and sesame seeds, if desired.</li>
